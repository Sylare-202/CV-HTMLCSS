# CV-HTMLCSS

These files and the source of a html and css work in 
which I had to make a complete responsive cv that could
be printed and watch on phone.

You have here the complete code that I made for a Cv on duty
from my school. This is the first time I program in html.
so please be indulgent, I am open to any criticism, good or bad.
(sorry for french word in it, i'm french student)
